            A gated residential community provides a sense of security just by
            the fact that entry to it is controlled. But security doesn’t end with
            access limits. Residents want to know that their properties are being
            watched especially when they are not at home. Being familiar with a
            community, its residents and its unique personality, means a security
            service is better equipped to keep it safe and can respond quickly and
            more effectively when issues arise.

          <p>
            A commercial building is any type of building that generates income.
            This can be an office building, industrial property, restaurant or
            retail establishment, storage facility, medical building, hotel, or
            even an apartment complex. Because buildings of these types generally
            are used only during specific hours, they are often deserted during
            off-hours and prone to unwanted activity.<br><br>
            American Veteran Security can provide regular patrols of commercial
            buildings either on foot or in patrol vehicles. They will inspect the
            interior and exterior of the buildings as requested during regular
            business as well as off-business hours. They will screen persons
            entering to make sure they are authorized to enter and will observe
            persons exiting so no property is removed without permission. They
            can also provide a security trained receptionist to direct customers
            and others to the appropriate location. Because their guards are
            trained to observe patterns of behavior, they are often able to
            prevent theft or other ill-intentioned events from occurring.

            Wine is central to much of life in Sonoma, Napa and Marin counties
            and winery events are becoming more and more a part of that.
            From one day to weekend events, from concerts and weddings to parties
            and fundraisers, each event has its particular needs for security and
            safety. By providing for the safety, security and protection of their
            guests, wineries will ensure that each event is an enjoyable experience
            for everyone who attends.

            By its nature, a healthcare facility needs to be a place where people
            can come and go freely, often at any hour of the day or night.
            Visitors may have their guard down, making themselves more vulnerable
            to theft or other unwanted behavior. The safety and security of staff
            is important so they can focus on their jobs, and patients recuperate
            and recover faster when they don’t worry about their safety. Whether
            the security is always visible or not, a healthcare facility cannot
            function well for long without it.

            Construction sites are often unoccupied on weekends and evenings making
            them vulnerable to vandalism and theft. Security cameras are helpful
            but don’t replace a human presence. Millions of dollars of equipment,
            materials and metals are set on fire, catch fire, or stolen from
            construction sites each year.
            <br><br>
            American Veteran Security performs regular or random patrols of your
            construction site preventing the loss of valuable items and keeping
            an eye out for any vandalism or other malicious behavior.
